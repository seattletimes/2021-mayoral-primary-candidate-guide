    Aug. 3 is the deadline to drop your ballot in the mail or in a King County Elections drop box. Find more information here, on this and other races, drop-box sites, the local votersâ€™ pamphlet, what to do if you lose your ballot and accessible voting centers for people with disabilities.
    This guide is based on answers candidates provided to a Seattle Times questionnaire in late May. Responses were edited for space, spelling and clarity. The eight candidates featured in the guide are the leading fundraisers in the race.
